# nodeChecker

## What?
With this tool, you can monitor many things, visuzlie them, and receive alerts when something goes wrong.  This is a light weight application which doesn't require it's own database, etc to use.  You can run it locally on your development machine to monitory your production environment.  

I'm based on node.js, a number of awesome npm packages, and the nodeDave api framework.
